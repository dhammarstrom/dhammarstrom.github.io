My previous attempts at maintaining a website have been failures. Why? Probably because the format triggers a non-trivial amount of bad academic habits and feelings like procrastination, focusing on unimportant details, seeking perfection, inferiority complex and so on. Another issue was probably that I (still) do not know who would like to read these notes.

My new attempt therefore has the following basic rules.

- Write short posts.
- Write for my own memory.
- Add/link stuff that I've done.
- Do not over-think posts.  

Great, the first post is done!
