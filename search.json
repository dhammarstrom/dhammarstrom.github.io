Probably because the format triggers a non-trivial amount of bad academic habits and feelings like procrastination, focusing on unimportant details, seeking perfection, inferiority complex and so on. Another issue was probably that I (still) do not know how would like to read these notes.\nMy new attempt therefore has the following basic rules.\n\nWrite short posts.\nWrite for my own memory.\nAdd/link stuff that I’ve done.\nDo not over-think posts.\n\nGreat, the first post is done!"
