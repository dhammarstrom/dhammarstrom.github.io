Probably because the format triggers a non-trivial amount of bad academic habits and feelings like procrastination, focusing on unimportant details, seeking perfection, inferiority complex and so on. Another issue was probably that I (still) do not know who would like to read these notes.\nMy new attempt therefore has the following basic rules.\n\nWrite short posts.\nWrite for my own memory.\nAdd/link stuff that I’ve done.\nDo not over-think posts.\n\nGreat, the first post is done!"

My investigative approach is interdisciplinary, weaving together physiology, statistical methods and bioinformatics in studies of exercise training.\nIn the realm of academics, I am involved in teaching research methods with focus on statistics and molecular biology as part of our Health and Exercise Physiology Master’s program. Additionally, I mentor students at various levels, overseeing the academic and research progression of Bachelor’s, Master’s, and Ph.D. candidates.\nI’m part of the trainome research group, collectively we want to better understand why and how people responds to exercise training and find out how we can design better exercise training interventions for different populations.\nYou can read my blog below or find me on Twitter, Mastodon or GitHub.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\nA new attempt at a website\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nnews\n\n\nblog\n\n\nnotes\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNov 2, 2023\n\n\nDaniel Hammarström\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNo matching items"
