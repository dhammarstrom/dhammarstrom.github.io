As an Associate Professor at the [Inland University of Applied Sciences](https://www.inn.no), where my research interests revolves around uncovering factors that contribute to the diverse responses individuals exhibit to exercise training. My investigative approach is interdisciplinary, weaving together statistical methods, bioinformatics, and physiology in exercise training studies.

In the realm of academics, I am involved in teaching molecular biology and statistical techniques as part of our Health and Exercise Physiology Master's program. Additionally, I mentor students at various levels, overseeing the academic and research progression of Bachelor's, Master's, and Ph.D. candidates.

I'm part of the [trainome research group](trainome.github.io), collectively we want to better understand why and how people responds to exercise training and find out how we can design better exercise training interventions for different populations.
